In this simple dart game, you'll need a scoreboard, three darts and a bunch of folks in a good mood.

The rules are simple: First, each player throws a dart looking away from the board to get a random number field. Once every player has a number, the aim of the game is to knock out others and be the last (wo)man standing. 

For each dart that lands on your number, you get a tally. Three tallies, you're out!

Make sure you don't do yourself in!
