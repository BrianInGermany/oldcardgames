A two-dice party game made for good liars.

## Setup
You'll need two dice, a dice cup and pen & paper. A beer coaster is useful to hold the dice in the cup.

## Gameplay
Each turn, players both dice and looks at the result without showing it to the others, and then they announce it to the rest of the table.

The crux of the game is that each subsequent roll must have a higher rank than the roll before! So fake it till you make it: if you don't roll higher, you're forced to lie. 

The top result is a "Mäxchen", or a 21, and next best are all the doubles starting with 66. Then comes everything else.

To read your score, always count the higher die as the tens digit and the lower die as the ones.

Thus, the picture above shows a 53.

## Making Points, Calling Bullshit
Mäxchen is like golf: the lower your score, the better.

For every lie that's uncovered, the liar gets one tally mark. But be careful calling bullshit!
- An unjustified "bullshit!" gets you two tallies.

Remember, each turn the next player has to announce a higher value than the one before, potentially all the way up to the top score of 21/Mäxchen.

E.G: if your predecessor announces a 66: Sorry, you're forced to go for a Mäxchen/21.
Obviously, your chances of actually getting that are low and the chances of your opponents calling your bluff very high.

### Reset after Bullshit
Whenever bullshit is called, the next player can begin from the bottom of the scale (can announce any result greater than or equal to 31). And upward it goes again.

### Special Scoring for 21
If you lie about having a 21, and you get caught: that's not one, but two points for you.
- If you call bullshit on a 21 and you're wrong, that's not two, but three points for you!

For this reason, you want to avoid mistakenly calling bullshit on a 21. Luckily, there's a strategy to minimize damage:

- If your predecessor calls a 21, you have the choice 1) to call their bluff, or 2) to believe them, and then yourself roll another 21!
- The chances of two 21s in a row are minimal, so your bullshit will probably be called. 
  - But: if you lie about having a 21, you only get two minus points-- whereas it's three for mistakenly calling bullshit on a 21.

#### Score Overview

| Situation | Score |
|-----|-----|
| Roller gets caught in a lie | 1 for the roller |
| Another player calls bullshit mistakenly | 2 for the doubter |
| Roller gets caught in a lie (21) | 2 for the roller |
| Another player calls bullshit mistakenly (21) | 3 for the doubter |

## Strategy
While any player call call bullshit, depending on where you're sitting it may make sense to keep your mouth shut and let the subsequent player assume the risk. They are the ones in the hot seat, given they are required to roll higher if they don't call the lie.

Remember: as soon as bullshit is called, the necessary score is reset to the lowest value of at least 31.

## Variants
### 21 is tops
The standard version of this game considers 21 to be untoppable, not even with another 21. 
- In this version, you get one minus point even for accepting the 21, two for getting caught in a lie about the 21, or three for mistakenly doubting it.
- Either way, the score resets before the next player rolls.
  
### Drinking Version
This game is often played as a drinking game, where instead of each point, you have to take a drink.

## Important Note on Scoring
Many rulesets for 21/Mäxchen state you get an equal number of minus points for lying or for mistakenly calling a bluff. 
- This doesn't work at all, because it makes calling a bluff too cheap: it usually leads to people robotically calling bullshit on all rolls above 62, for which the probability of the roll is always under 50%.
