A super easy party game about racking up points-- without going bust!

![](/assets/images/dice1.jpg)

## Setup
You need exactly one die, a dice cup and pen & paper.

## Gameplay
Each player may roll the die as many times as they want to rack up points-- just don't roll a one!

- The aim of the game is to roll as high as possible for as many times as possible and to pass off the die before rolling a one.
- If you roll a one, you only lose the points made on this round. Point scored in previous rounds are locked in!

### End of Turn
Your turn ends when you choose to stop rolling or, at the latest, when you roll a one.

### Example

| Times Rolled | Rolled Value     | Cumulative Points |
|-----| ------------------------ | ----------- |
|1| 6     | 6           |
|2| 5                 | 11           |
|3| 3                  | 14          |
|4| 5                 | 19          |
|5| 1        | 0         |



## Scoring
To keep score you need a paper with a column for each player in which you record each round's score in a new row:

| Jim | Brian     | Sally |
|-----| ------------------------ | ----------- |
|19| 0    | 0          |
|0| 20                 | 11           |
|0| 0                 | 25          |
|0| 33                 | 0        |
|SUM|SUM|SUM|
|19|53|36|
