A two-dice party game made for liars and risk takers.

## Setup
You'll need two dice and a dice cup If you don't want to take score with drinks, you'll need pen & paper. 
- A beer coaster is useful to hold the dice in the cup.
## Roll Values
To read your roll, always count the higher die as the tens digit and the lower die as the ones.

Thus, the picture above shows a 53.

## Gameplay
Each turn, the player rolls both dice and looks at the result without showing it to the others, and then announces that number to the rest of the table, along with the current value of the cup.

After the first roll, the cup is worth one. If I roll a 52, I would say "52, worth one".

The "worth" indicates how many points the player will lose who mistakenly calls bullshit-- or gets caught in a lie. The first roll is automatically worth one.

### Calling Bullshit
After each announced roll, any player at the table may call bullshit. 
- If the bullshit caller is correct, the liar drinks as many sips as the cup is currently worth.
- If the bullshit caller is mistaken, the bullshit caller drinks as many sips as the cup is worth.
- After bullshit was called, the value of the cup is reset to one.
- If no one calls bullshit, the next player rolls the dice.

### Options When Rolling  
When rolling the dice, players have two options:
1. Announce a higher number than the player before, thus raising the stakes and increasing the value of the cup by one. In this case the player passes the cup to the next player.
2. Announce a lower number: you can play it safe and choose not to up the ante, but it will cost you one sip.

### The Worst Case Scenario: 21
In Offenbach Bullshit, it's not only about catching opponents in a lie-- it's about knowing when to end the escalation and avoid the worst case scenario...

> The highest roll is 21. When a player rolls 21, she shows the dice openly and all other players drink the current value of the cup! :)

### Resetting the Cup /Ending Round
After a 21 (or whenever the dice are revealed), the loser drinks the value of the cup and the cup value is reset to one.
- After a 21, the cup is passed to the next player.
- After a bullshit, the loser must roll (even if they just did).

## Strategy
Play with the probabilities... If
