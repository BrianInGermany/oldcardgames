Win the bid, and trump your way to victory with this chip-based Tapp Tarock variant.

Not just for fortune telling! Offenbach Tapp is a fun trick-taking game with the added fascination of the fifth suit, tarot.

## The Cards
![](/assets/images/tarock.jpg)  

This game is played with a 54-card tarot deck. There are four suits (spades, clubs, hearts and diamonds), plus the additional fifth suit "tarot", which is a permanent trump suit. Fun fact: the origin of the word "trump" comes from the earlier designation of the tarots in Italian, "le trionfi".

### Regular Suits
In contrast to a regular deck, there are __four__ face cards: King, Queen, Knight and Jack.
In further contrast to a regular deck, the kings are the highest cards by trick rank besides the tarots.

There is a difference between red and black suits, too: in hearts and diamonds, the trick rank after K-Q-Kn-J is A-2-3-4, and those are all the cards present in those suits.

In clubs and spades, the trick rank after the face cards is 10-9-8-7, and these again are the entirety of the cards in those suits.

### Tarots
The trick rank of the tarot cards is equal to their numbers, which go from 1-21. The highest trick rank among the tarots, however, is the "Sküs" (say "skyooz", derived from French "excusez"-- which you might say when taking all your opponents cards :P ). The Sküs does not have a number, but instead looks kind of like the joker of a regular deck. The Sküs, the 21 tarot, called the Mond, and the 1 tarot, called the Pagat, are the three tarots worth the most points and known together as the honneurs.

## Setup
At the start of the game, six cards are dealt face down in two packs of three in the center of the table. These are called the "tapp" (hence the name of the game).
- Sixteen cards are then dealt to each player in four packs of four.
- The game begins by players bidding for the chance to earn points by winning the round.
  - Depending on the bid, you can use the tapp cards to improve your hand.

## Object of the Game
The goal of Offenbach Tapp is to make points by beating your two opponents alone or beating your one opponent together.

Bidding determines who gets to be the single opponent. Beginning with the player to the right of the dealer (game is played counter-clockwise), players look at their cards and judge whether they want to attempt to win the game alone by collecting the majority of possible card points. There are 70 points in the deck, so to win, you need 36. In most cases, if you win the bid, you get to improve your hand with cards from the tapp.

### Bidding, Bonuses and Countering

#### __Bid Levels__
There are four bids that can be made, each subsequent level only possible after one player has bid the previous. 

| Bids in Ascending Order   | Description                                                                   | Pay Out |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Three | Bidwinnner gets to choose either of the two packs of three cards from the tapp.   | 20      |
| Two   | Bidwinner gets to choose one of the three adjacent pairs of cards from the tapp. | 40      |
| One   | Bidwinner gets to choose one of the cards from the tapp.                         | 60      |
| Solo  | Bidwinner has to play without any cards from the tapp.                           | 100      |


In all the bids except the "solo", the winning bidder has the chance to improve their hand by exchanging with cards from the tapp. 

#### __Bonus__
In addition to the bids, there are bonuses, which can be won by any player and are also paid out by the other players 50/50.


| Bonus        | Description                                        | Pay Out |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Pagat Ultimo | Win the Pagat (1) on the last trick                | 20    |
| Honneur      | Win all three honneurs (Pagat (1), Mond (21), Sküs) | 20    |
| Four Kings   | Win all four kings                                 | 20    |
| Absolut      | Win with 40 points or more                         | 20  |
| Grandpoint   | Win with 50 points or more                         | 40    |


#### __Bidding Process__
In the bidding, players can pass or bid, but once they pass they are excluded from the rest of the bidding. The first bid is always "three", and goes up the scale to "two", "one", and "solo".

If a player is outbid, they have the right to accept the higher bid as their own by saying "I hold", but also the option to raise again to the next highest bid.

#### __Bidding Examples__

Player 2 bids, is outbid, and then takes the higher bid as his own. Player 3 decides not to outbid again:
- Player 1: "pass"
- Player 2: "three"
- Player 3: "two"
- Player 1: (SKIPPED)
- Player 2: "I hold (the two)"
- Player 3: "pass"
- END (Player 2 wins the bid.)

Player 1 bids, player 2 outbids, player 3 passes and players 1 and 2 don't bid further:
- Player 1: "three"
- Player 2: "two"
- Player 3: "pass"
- Player 1: "pass"
- END (Player 2 wins the bid.)

Same arrangement, but player 1 tries to announce a bonus:
- Player 1: "three"
- Player 2: "two"
- Player 3: "pass"
- Player 1: "I hold"
- Player 2: "one"
- Player 3: (SKIPPED)
- Player 1: "pass"
- END (Player 2 wins the bid.)

#### __Countering Examples__
Once a bid is won, players have the option to counter the win, doubling the points to be won or lost in that round. This is done by saying "contra" or "I counter the three", for example.
- Both bids and bonus announcements can be countered.
  
Player 3 bids, player 1 passes and later counters:
- Player 1: "pass"
- Player 2: "pass"
- Player 3: "three"
- Player 1: "contra"
- Player 2: "pass"
- Player 3: "pass"
- END (Player 3 wins the bid with a counter, playing for double stakes.)

In rare cases, the player may want to double down on the counter, showing she is even more sure of herself and securing even more potential points by saying "recontra":

- Player 1: "pass"
- Player 2: "pass"
- Player 3: "three"
- Player 1: "contra on the three"
- Player 2: "pass"
- Player 3: "recontra"
- END (Player 3 playes for quadruple stakes on the three.)
  
### Exchanging Cards
Once the bid is won, in all games except "solo", the bidwinner can exchange cards from the tapp, and the tapp is flipped over for all to see. The bidwinner exchanges the specified number of cards, and the discarded cards count towards the bidwinner's trick points, while the untouched tapp cards belong to the opponents' tricks. Note: you may discard cards you just picked up.
- Kings and Sküs, Mond (21) and Pagat (1) may not be discarded, because they are worth five points each, and would immediately land in your tricks, giving you an unfair advantage.
- Tarot can only be discarded if you have no other suited cards to discard.
- Cards are discarded face-up.

### Trick Taking
The player who won the bid plays the first card. The highest ranked card takes the trick, and the winner of the trick plays the next card. You need 36 points to win the game.

### Scoring
At the end of each game, trick points are counted to determine who gets paid how much.

#### __Trick Points__
Tarock traditionally uses an unusual method of counting trick points. Group cards into packs of three, add the point values of each card, and then subtract two from the sum. It's actually fairly easy to count this way, simply group two one-pointer cards like normal tarots or the numbered suits with one higher card, and you can just ignore the one-pointers. Sometimes you'll end up with multiple high cards in a pack of three.

For example:

- Queen of Hearts / 5 of Hearts / Tarot 3 = (4 + 1 + 1) - 2 = 4
- Jack of Spades / Tarot 14 / Tarot 18 = (2 + 1 + 1) - 2 = 2
- King of Diamonds / Tarot 12 / Sküs = (5 + 1 + 5) - 2 = 9

>Tip: If you're not a stickler for tradition you can use a simplified point system where you just add up the cards' values. No need for counting in threes and subtracting two. You still win with 36.

| Card by Trick Rank | Points (Traditional) | Points (Simplified) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Sküs               | 5                    | 5                   |
| Mond (21)          | 5                    | 5                   |
| Other Tarots (2-20)  | 1                    | 0                   |
| Pagat (1)          | 5                    | 5                   |

| Knight             | 3                    | 3                   |
| Jack               | 2                    | 2                   |
| 10/A               | 1                    | 0                   |
| 9/2                | 1                    | 0                   |
| 8/3                | 1                    | 0                   |
| 7/4                | 1                    | 0                   |


#### __Pay Outs__
If the bidwinner wins the game as promised, the other players pay her for the win according to the below table, each paying half the pay out. If the bidwinner loses, each opponent gets paid half. 

Bonuses are also paid 50/50 by the other players.
