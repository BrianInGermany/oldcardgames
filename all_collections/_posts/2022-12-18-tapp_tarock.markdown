Risk a bid, and trump your way to victory with this classic tarot game.  

Not just for future tellling! Tapp Tarock is a fun trick-taking game with the added fascination of the fifth suit, tarot.

## The Cards
![](/assets/images/tarock.jpg)  

This game is played with a 54-card tarot deck. There are four suits (spades, clubs, hearts and diamonds), plus the additional fifth suit "tarot", which is a permanent trump suit. Fun fact: the origin of the word "trump" comes from the earlier designation of the tarots in Italian, "le trionfi".

### Regular Suits
In contrast to a regular deck, there are __four__ face cards: King, Queen, Knight and Jack.
In further contrast to a regular deck, the kings are the highest cards by trick rank besides the tarots.

There is a difference between red and black suits, too: in hearts and diamonds, the trick rank after K-Q-Kn-J is A-2-3-4, and those are all the cards present in those suits.

In clubs and spades, the trick rank after the face cards is 10-9-8-7, and these again are the entirety of the cards in those suits.

### Tarot Cards
The trick rank of the tarot cards is equal to their numbers, which go from 1-21. The highest trick rank among the tarots, however, is the "Sküs" (say "skyooz", derived from French "excusez"-- which you might say when taking all your opponents cards :P ). The Sküs does not have a number, but instead looks kind of like the joker of a regular deck. The Sküs, the 21 tarot, called the Mond, and the 1 tarot, called the Pagat, are the three tarots worth the most points.

## Setup
At the start of the game, six cards are dealt face down in two packs of three in the center of the table. These are called the "tapp" (hence the name of the game).
- Sixteen cards are then dealt to each player in four packs of four.
- The game begins by players bidding for the chance to earn points by winning the round.
  - Depending on the bid, you can use the tapp cards to improve your hand.

## Object of the Game
The goal of Tapp Tarock is to make points by beating your two opponents alone or beating your one opponent together.

Bidding determines who gets to be the single opponent. Beginning with the player to the right of the dealer (game is played counter-clockwise), players look at their cards and judge whether they want to attempt to win the game alone by collecting the majority of possible card points. There are 70 points in the deck, so to win, you need 36. In most cases, if you win the bid, you get to improve your hand with cards from the tapp.

### Bidding
There are four bids that can be made, each subsequent level only possible after one player has bid the previous. 
| Level | Bid   | Description                                                                   |
| ---- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Three | Winner gets to choose either of the two packs of three cards from the tapp.   |
| 2    | Two   | Winner gets to choose one of the three adjacent pairs of cards from the tapp. |
| 3    | One   | Winner gets to choose one of the cards from the tapp.                         |
| 4    | Solo  | Winner has to play without any cards from the tapp.                           |

In all the bids except the "solo", the winning bidder has the chance to improve their hand by exchanging with cards from the tapp. 

- Players can pass or bid, but once they pass they are excluded from the rest of the bidding.
- The first bid is always "three", and goes up the scale to "two", "one", and "solo".
- If a player is outbid, they have the right to accept the higher bid as their own by saying "I hold", but the option to raise again to the next highest bid.

#### __Example Bidding__
Player 2 bids, is outbid, and then takes the higher bid as his own. Player 3 decides not to outbid again:
- Player 1: "pass"
- Player 2: "three"
- Player 3: "two"
- Player 1: (SKIPPED)
- Player 2: "I hold"
- Player 3: "pass"
- END
  
Once the bid is won, in all games except "solo", the bidwinner can exchange cards from the tapp.

### Exchanging Cards
Once a player has one the bid with a "three", "two" or "one", the tapp is flipped over, and the bidwinner exchanges the specified number of cards. The discarded cards count towards the bidwinner's trick points, and the untouched tapp cards belong to the opponents' tricks. You may discard cards you just picked up.
- Kings and Sküs, Mond (21) and Pagat (1) may not be discarded, because they are worth five points each, and would immediately land in your tricks, giving you an unfair advantage.
- Tarot can only be discarded if you have no other suited cards to discard.

### Gameplay
The player who won the bid plays the first card. The highest ranked card takes the trick, and the winner of the trick plays the next card. You need 36 points to win the game.

### Scoring
#### __Trick Points__
Tarock uses an unusual method of counting trick points. Group cards into packs of three, add the point values of each card, and then subtract two from this number. It is actually fairly easy to count this way, simply group two one-pointer cards like normal tarots or the numbered suits with one high-pointer card, and you can just ignore the one-pointers. 

For example:

- Queen of Hearts / 5 of Hearts / Tarot 3 = (4 + 1 + 1) - 2 = 4
- Jack of Spades / Tarot 14 / Tarot 18 = (2 + 1 + 1) - 2 = 2
- King of Diamonds / Tarot 12 / Sküs = (5 + 1 + 5) - 2 = 9

| Card by Trick Rank  | Points |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Sküs               | 5      |
| Mond (21)          | 5      |
| Pagat (1)           | 5      |
| Other Tarots        | 1      |
| King                | 5      |
| Queen               | 4      |
| Knight              | 3      |
| Jack                | 2      |
| 10/A                | 1      |
| 9/2                 | 1      |
| 8/3                 | 1      |
| 7/4                 | 1      |

#### __Overall Points__
If the winner of the bid wins the game as promised, they get points for that bid according to the below table. If the bidwinner loses, each opponent gets the same points added to their score:

| Rank | Bid   | Points |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 1    | Three | 3      |
| 2    | Two   | 4      |
| 3    | One   | 5      |
| 4    | Solo  | 8      |

#### __Bonus__
If any player wins the final trick with the Pagat (1), they get two bonus points on their overall score.
