Combine luck with strategy to make tricks and reach 66 before your opponent! 

![](/assets/images/66.jpg)

66 is played with a 24-card deck, using only the nines through aces.
- For added fun, you can use a [German-face deck](https://www.piatnik.com/spiele/spielkarten/regionale-karten/blitz-salzburger) as pictured above, but an ordinary pack of cards will work just as well.
- The game is played with 2 players.  
- A nearly identical Austrian variant played without the nines (Schnapsen), using only 20 cards.

## Setup
- At the start of the game, each player is dealt six cards (five cards if playing without nines).
- An additional card is uncovered an placed under the deck perpendicularly. This is the trump suit.
- The game begins by the first player playing a card.

## Gameplay
The aim of 66 is to make tricks and announcements to accumulate 66 points before your opponent. 

### Making tricks
To make a trick, the opponent must play a higher card of the same suit or a trump card.
  - You are not required to follow suit or make a trick.
  - The player who makes the trick plays the next card. 
  - After each trick, each player draws another card (until the deck runs out).
  
#### Scoring of Tricks
 | Card by Trick Rank | Points |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Ace                | 11     |
| 10                 | 10     |
| King               | 4      |
| Queen/Ober         | 3      |
| Jack/Unter         | 2      |
| 9                  | 0      |

### Marriages

Marriages consist of a queen and king (Ober and Unter) of the same suit.
- You can make only announce a marriage if it's your turn to begin the trick, and you must play one of those cards after claiming it.  
Marriages are worth the following points:  
- 40 points for a marriage in trump
- 20 points for each non-trump marriage 

### Closing the deck
You can pressure your opponent into the corner by closing the deck (on your turn).
- As soon as the deck is closed (or runs out), players are __forced to make a trick or follow suit__ if possible.
If the deck was closed, the closing player must win (by reaching 66)!
- If she doesn't, the opponent receives all the points they would have received, but at least two.
Once the deck has been closed, the defending player does not get points for any tricks or announcements she may make from that time until the end of the round.  

### Stealing the trump
If you have the lowest trump card, you can exchange it when it's your turn for the trump under the deck.  

## End of Game
If you think you have reached 66 points, just say "66" or "enough!" when it's your turn to end the round. But watch out-- if you don't actually have 66 your opponent will get extra points! You can look at your tricks at any time.
  - Even if both players actually have 66, the first one to call it wins.  
### Scoring
  - If you make 66 and the opponent has 33 or more, you receive one point.
  - If the opponent has less than 33, you receive two points.
  - If the opponent has made no tricks, you receive three points.
  - If you say "enough!" but don't have 66, your opponent gets at least two points, or however many you would have won if you had had 66.
  - __Seven match points wins!__
    - Loser buys the next round :)

Fun tip with German cards:
- You can use one of the sevens covered up by another card to track your match points.
