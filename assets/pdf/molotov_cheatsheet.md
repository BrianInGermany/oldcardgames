# Molotov Jass Cheat Sheet
## Setup
With a 36 card deck (6-A), shuffle and divide the deck equally between each player, dealing out in groups of three cards.
- With three players 4x3 each.
- With four players 3x3 each.
- With five players, remove the 6 of bells/diamonds and then deal 4+3 each.

## Trump
At the beginning of the game, there is no trump. The first card that cannot follow suit becomes the trump suit. 
- The jack/unter and nine of trumps become Bur and Nell retroactively. Be wary of nines and jacks early on.

## Following Suit
If you have the suit that has been played, you must 1) follow suit or 2) play a trump. You have the option to play a trump even if you could follow suit.
- If you don't have the suit played, you can play any other card. You don't have to play a trump.

## Scoring
Think backwards: in molotov, you aim for the fewest points possible.
