<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>With a 52 card deck (plus jokers if you want some added spice), deal each player 10 cards face-down on a grid of 5x2.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place the remaining cards in the center to serve as the draw pile.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
<p>The aim of the game is to fill all ten positions on the grid with the appropriate numbers before your opponent can!</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The starting player draws a card. If it’s between A-10, place it on the appropriate position on your grid and look at the face-down card that was holding the place.</p>

<p>That card can also be played if the space for its number is open on your grid. You may play as many cards in a row as you can put in the correct grid position without interruption.</p>

<p>Whenever you reveal a card you cannot put into position, you discard it and your turn ends.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facecards are “duds” and always must be discarded, ending your turn.</li>
  <li>Jokers are wild, and can be placed in any space.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<p>The first person to fill all ten positions with A-10 wins!</p>
