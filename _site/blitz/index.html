<p>Blitz is played with a 32-card deck, using only the sevens through aces.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For added fun, you can use a <a href="https://www.piatnik.com/spiele/spielkarten/regionale-karten/doppeldeutsche-blitz-36-blatt">German-face deck</a> as pictured above, but an ordinary pack of cards will work just as well.</li>
  <li>The game is played best with 3-7 players.</li>
  <li>It’s also known as 31 or Scat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At the start of the game, each player is given three lives (matchsticks, coins, etc.).</li>
  <li>Each player is dealt three cards.
    <ul>
      <li>The dealer inspects her cards, and has the option to keep them or put them in the center and take three new cards.
        <ul>
          <li>If the dealer keeps her cards, three additional cards from the deck are placed in the center.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The player to the left of the dealer is first to play.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The aim of Blitz is to gather three cards of the same suit for the highest score.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aces are worth 11, face cards 10, and all other cards are worth their number value.</li>
  <li>Each turn, players may exchange <em>one or all cards, but not two</em>.</li>
  <li>The round ends in one of three ways:
    <ol>
      <li>A player reaches 31 points</li>
      <li>A player has three aces (blitz).</li>
      <li>A player closes the round
        <ul>
          <li>Closing is denoted by knocking and is only possible after the first round.</li>
          <li>If you choose to close, you may not exchange cards, and the game ends after every other player has one more chance to play.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<p>The player(s) with the lowest score loses one life. Once all a player’s lives are gone, she is “swimming” on one final life, after which she loses.</p>

<h2 id="additional-important-rules">Additional Important Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a player gets three aces, the game is immediately over, and every other player loses one life.
    <ul>
      <li>“Blitz!”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Three-of-a-kind is worth exactly 30.5 points.</li>
  <li>You can always pass instead of exchanging cards or closing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategy-tips">Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The earlier you can get a high score, the earlier you can “knock” to jump the gun on opponents that haven’t had time to collect points.</li>
  <li>Make sure you don’t accidentally create a good hand in the bank by exchanging cards.
    <ul>
      <li>Remember, the next player can take all three cards!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
