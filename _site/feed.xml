<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>With a 36 card deck (6-A), shuffle and divide the deck equally between each player, dealing out in groups of three cards (with 3P 4x3, with 4P 3x3 each).</p>

<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
<p>The aim of the game is to score as low as possible by make as few and as cheap tricks as possible. And avoid being bombed with a molotov!</p>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>When you win a trick, you add the cards’ point value to your score. The player that makes the final trick gets an additional five points.</p>

<h3 id="molotovs">Molotovs!</h3>
<p>If a molotov appears on the table, the winner of the trick gets bombed another 20 or 50 points. A molotov is three or four cards <strong>of the same suit</strong> in sequence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small molotov = three in a row

<h2 id="making-tricks">Making Tricks</h2>
<p>You win a trick by playing the highest card (by trick rank). If you win the trick, you start the next trick. As in other games, any trump card beats even the best card of another suit.</p>

<h3 id="determining-trump">Determining Trump</h3>
<p>The game begins without a trump and the first card played that can’t follow suit becomes the trump for the round.</p>

<h3 id="following-suit">Following Suit</h3>
<p>When an opponent starts the trick and you have a card of that suit, you must follow suit or play a trump. If you don’t have a card of the same suit, you can play any other card (wrong suit <strong>or trump</strong>).</p>
<ul>
  <li>One exception: you don’t have to follow suit with the Bur (trump Unter/Jack, the game’s highest card).</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not required to make a trick, and can intentionally lose a trick, as long as you follow suit.</p>

<h2 id="scorekeeping">Scorekeeping</h2>
<p>The two players with the lowest round score write one tally, the highest player writes a “sack” (if playing with four, one player gets neither a tally nor a sack).</p>
<ul>
  <li>To get “out of the sack”, the player has to make another tally, crossing through the 0 with a line:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/sack_strich.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The round is over when all the cards have been played.</li>
  <li>The game is over when one or more players reach five tallies. If several players reach five tallies simultaneosly, the lowest score of the final round decides the winner.</li>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/constancejass.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>With a 36 card deck (6-A), shuffle and deal each player three cards face down twice, so that each player has a row of six face-down cards in front of them. Then deal cards face-up on top of them, again 2x3. These are your table cards.</p>

<p>Deal another 2x3 cards per player for your hand.</p>

<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
<p>The aim of the game is to make tricks as fast as possible to either fulfill the bid, or keep the opponent from reaching it. Win five rounds and you are the victor.</p>

<h2 id="bidding">Bidding</h2>
<p>The game starts by each player inspecting their hand and estimating how many points they will be able to make. There are 157 total points in the game, so it can make sense to start bidding around 60. You must bid in increments of five. The non-dealer begins the bidding and the winner of the bid chooses the trump and plays first.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This can be very decisive because the high bidder will attempt to choose the trump in which she has a “Bur” or “Nell” (see scoring below).</li>
  <li>Variant rule: if you don’t want to choose a trump, you can play “Bock”, “Gais” or “Slalom” (without trumps, eights are worth eight points to compensate)
    <ul>
      <li>Bock: aces highest trick rank, eights worth eight</li>
      <li>Gais: sixes highest trick rank, eights worth eight</li>
      <li>Slalom: alternate Bock and Gais every trick</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>When you win a trick, you add the cards’ point value to your score. The player that makes the final trick gets an additional five points.</p>

<h2 id="making-tricks">Making Tricks</h2>
<p>In Jass, you win a trick by playing the highest card (by trick rank). If you win the trick, you get to start the next trick. As in other games, any trump card can beat even the best card of another suit.</p>

<p>In Lake Constance Jass, <strong>you can choose to play a card from your hand or from your table cards</strong>. Once the trick is won, turn over any freshly revealed face-down cards.</p>

<h3 id="following-suit">Following Suit</h3>
<p>When an opponent starts the trick and you have a card of that suit, you must follow suit or play a trump. If you don’t have a card of the same suit, you can play any other card (wrong suit <strong>or trump</strong>).</p>
<ul>
  <li>One exception: you don’t have to follow suit with the Bur (trump Unter/Jack, the game’s highest card).</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not required to make a trick, and can intentionally lose a trick, as long as you follow suit.</p>

<h2 id="scorekeeping">Scorekeeping</h2>
<p>If the winner of the bid fulfills their bid, they write one tally. If they miss it, the opponent writes one tally. If either player makes 20 or less points, they are “in the sack”. This means the winner writes a tally as usual, and the big loser writes a “0”, which is equivalent to a negative tally. To get “out of the sack”, the player has to win another round, crossing through the 0 with a line:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/sack_strich.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<p>When one player has reached enough points that it’s impossible for the opponent to win, she can say “enough!” to end the game. Otherwise, the game ends when all cards have been played.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/durak.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Durak can be played with a standard 52-card deck or, for a faster version, with a 36-card (6-A) deck.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This fast-paced party game is popular in former Soviet countries and well-known in parts of central Europe.</li>
  <li>The game is best with 4-8 players. If playing with more than six, use a 52-card deck.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At the start of the game, each player is dealt six cards.</li>
  <li>An additional card is uncovered and placed under the deck perpendicularly. This is the trump for the round.</li>
  <li>The game begins by the first player putting down a card, an attack on the player to their left.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
<p>The aim of Durak is to shed all your cards as soon as possible. The last (wo-)man standing is the loser, and is called the Durak, or “dummy”!</p>

<h2 id="attacking-and-defending">Attacking and Defending</h2>
<p>If it’s your turn, it means you’re the first attacker, the person to your left is the defender, and the person on the other side of the defender is the second attacker.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The defender is always surrounded by two attackers! :smiling_imp: (until less than three players remain).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attacking">Attacking</h3>
<p>To attack, lay down a card in front of the defender. If you have multiples of the same number, you may lay down as many of that same card down as you like. The defender has to produce a higher card of the same suit (or a trump) for each attacking card.</p>

<p>Here’s where it gets interesting: 
Any time after the first attack has hit the table, the other attacker can also attack with any cards of that same number. And as soon as the defender plays a card, that number, too, is now fair game for the attackers to play and double-down the offense!</p>

<h3 id="defending">Defending</h3>
<p>You don’t have to attempt a defense; sometimes its safer to just take the cards your attacked with and continue the game.</p>

<p>If you succeed in fighting off each and every attack card your opponents play, you’ve succeeding in shedding some cards, and it’s now your turn to be the first attacker and shed some more.</p>

<p>If you can’t defend, pick up all the cards on the table, and your turn is skipped. The player to your left continues.</p>

<h4 id="special-defense">Special Defense</h4>
<p>If you’re attacked with a number you have in your own hand, play it to push the attack off to the next player :sweat_smile:.</p>

<h2 id="drawing-cards">Drawing Cards</h2>
<p>After each failed or successful round of attacks, players draw back to six cards in the following order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First Attacker</li>
  <li>Second Attacker</li>
  <li>Defender</li>
</ol>

<p>This order is important, because the deck will run out at some point, and the fewer cards you have, the less likely you are to become the Durak!</p>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<p>The game continues until every player except one has shed all their cards. Give that dude a funny hat and call him a Durak! The Durak starts the next round.</p>]]></content><author><name>Brian Junker-Latocha</name><email>brian@funcardgames.net</email></author><category term="manyplayer" /><category term="easy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gang up on (defenseless? ;) ) opponents in this souped-up version of War for 4-8 players.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Get Your Kicks With ‘66’: A Classic German Cardgame</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sixty-six/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Get Your Kicks With ‘66’: A Classic German Cardgame" /><published>2022-10-09T23:34:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-10-09T23:34:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sixty-six</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sixty-six/"><![CDATA[<p>Use memory and strategy to make tricks and reach 66 before your opponent!</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="closing-the-deck">Closing the deck</h3>
<p>You can pressure your opponent by closing the deck (on your turn).</p>
<ul>

If the deck was closed, the closing player must win (by reaching 66)!</li>
  <li>If they don’t, the opponent receives all the points they would have received, but at least two.
Once the deck has been closed, the defending player does not get points for any tricks or announcements they may make from that time until the end of the round.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exchanging-a-low-trump">Exchanging a low trump</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you have the lowest trump card, you can exchange it when it’s your turn for the trump under the deck.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you think you have reached 66 points, just say “66” or “enough!” when it’s your turn to end the round. But watch out– if you don’t actually have 66 your opponent will get extra points!
    <ul>
      <li>Even if both players actually have 66, the first one to call it wins.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scoring
    <ul>

      <li>If the opponent has made no tricks, you receive three points.</li>
      <li>If you say “enough!” but don’t have 66, your opponent gets at least two points, or however many you would have won if you had had 66.</li>
      <li><strong>Seven match points wins!</strong></li>

In this fun Blackjack predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blitz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Blitz is played with a 32-card deck, using only the sevens through aces.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For added fun, you can use a <a href="https://www.piatnik.com/spiele/spielkarten/regionale-karten/doppeldeutsche-blitz-36-blatt">German-face deck</a> as pictured above, but an ordinary pack of cards will work just as well.</li>
  <li>The game is played best with 3-7 players.</li>
  <li>It’s also known as 31 or Scat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At the start of the game, each player is given three lives (matchsticks, coins, etc.).</li>
  <li>Each player is dealt three cards.
    <ul>
      <li>The dealer inspects her cards, and has the option to keep them or put them in the center and take three new cards.
        <ul>
          <li>If the dealer keeps her cards, three additional cards from the deck are placed in the center.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The player to the left of the dealer is first to play.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The aim of Blitz is to gather three cards of the same suit for the highest score.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aces are worth 11, face cards 10, and all other cards are worth their number value.</li>
  <li>Each turn, players may exchange <em>one or all cards, but not two</em>.</li>
  <li>The round ends in one of three ways:
    <ol>
      <li>A player reaches 31 points</li>
      <li>A player has three aces (blitz).</li>
      <li>A player closes the round
        <ul>
          <li>Closing is denoted by knocking and is only possible after the first round.</li>
          <li>If you choose to close, you may not exchange cards, and the game ends after every other player has one more chance to play.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="end-of-game">End of Game</h2>
<p>The player(s) with the lowest score loses one life. Once all a player’s lives are gone, she is “swimming” on one final life, after which she loses.</p>

<h2 id="additional-important-rules">Additional Important Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a player gets three aces, the game is immediately over, and every other player loses one life.
    <ul>
      <li>“Blitz!”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Three-of-a-kind is worth exactly 30.5 points.</li>
  <li>You can always pass instead of exchanging cards or closing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategy-tips">Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The earlier you can get a high score, the earlier you can “knock” to jump the gun on opponents that haven’t had time to collect points.</li>
  <li>Make sure you don’t accidentally create a good hand in the bank by exchanging cards.
    <ul>
      <li>Remember, the next player can take all three cards!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
